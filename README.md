## CIS 4400: Directions Homework 1

### Homework 1

#### Data Sourcing 
- **Link of all data sources:**  
  [Citi Bike System Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)  
  [Citi Bike Trip Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)

- **Explanation of the data (where does it come from):**  
  The data comes from Lyft Citi Bike's internal reporting of their Citi Bike usage. Citi Bike riders have accounts that determine whether they're a member or not. Citi Bike riders scan the QR code on Citi Bike through the app at a Citi Bike station. The Citi Bike has its own unique ID, as does the Citi Bike station. When a bike is locked in another dock, data is uploaded within Lyft’s data infrastructure system. When accessing the source, the published data is stored in Amazon's cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS).
